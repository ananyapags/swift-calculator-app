# Swift-calculator-app

This project introduced me to Mobile App development and the Swift Language.
The goal was to create a simple, functioning Calculator app with a well-organized UI. I wanted to not only create an app but also understand how to organize components in Swift efficiently.

For me, this project was an enjoyable way to get into mobile app development. I took a concept I was familiar with (building a calculator) and applied it in a way that furthered my understanding of full-stack development. It helped me open doors to what I can create app-wise by showing me how approachable the whole process is!

I would say the most exciting part of this project was learning Swift. It had been a while since I learned a newer language, but I could pick it up fast as It had a structure similar to other languages I've used. Learning how to organize the code while building an app was a bit confusing, but I got the hang of with by watching video tutorials.
